        The main purpose of your About Us page is to give your visitors a glimpse into who you are as a person or a
        business (or sometimes both).

        As users discover your brand, they need to distinguish what sets you apart and makes you… you.

        This often requires finding the right balance between compelling content and a design carefully planned to look
        the part.

        Conveying your identity in a fun and approachable – but also reliable and informative – way is challenging.

        If you know who you are and your goal for your site, the About Us page should come naturally.
